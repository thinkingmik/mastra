 *
 * `transaction()` takes the gate and releases it when the transaction commits,
 * rolls back, or closes. `execute`, `batch`, `executeMultiple`, `migrate`, and `sync`
 * wait for the gate to be free before running but do not hold it — the driver
 * executes them synchronously on the connection, so they cannot interleave
 * with each other. Every other member passes through untouched.
 *
 * Callers must not issue client calls from inside their own open transaction
 * (use `tx.execute`); such a call would wait for the transaction it is part of.
