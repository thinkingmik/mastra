Observational Memory no longer blocks an agent step on the Observer as soon as unobserved messages reach `messageTokens` with async buffering enabled. Between `messageTokens` and `observation.blockAfter` (default `1.2`, so 36k tokens with the default 30k threshold), background buffering keeps running and the next ready chunk activates on a later step. A blocking synchronous observation now runs only when pending tokens still reach `blockAfter` after buffered activation, and observes only the uncovered tail. Previously, reaching the threshold without a ready chunk forced a blocking Observer call, and buffering couldn't start above the threshold, so long agent sessions blocked on observation turn after turn.

Unobserved messages can now grow up to `blockAfter` before a step blocks. To keep the previous behavior of observing synchronously at the threshold, set `blockAfter: 1`:

```ts
observationalMemory: {
  observation: { messageTokens: 30_000, blockAfter: 1 },
}
```

A multiplier `blockAfter` now scales a per-thread `messageTokens` override instead of the instance threshold. With `blockAfter: 1.2`, this thread blocks at 12,000 tokens:

```ts
await memory.updateObservationalMemoryConfig({
  threadId,
  config: { observation: { messageTokens: 10_000 } },
});
```

`getStatus()` also returns `observationBlockAfter` and `inAsyncObservationBand`.

If an in-flight chunk write outlasts the bounded activation wait, observation defers to a later step without discarding messages or completed activations. This prevents duplicate observation and preserves cursor order when the write finishes.

Fixed semantic recall missing a turn's new user message when background buffering picked it up on the first step.

Fixed buffered observations being lost when a reflection activated while they were still being generated. The observations were saved to the previous memory generation, never activated, and their messages were observed again later. They are now saved to the current generation.
